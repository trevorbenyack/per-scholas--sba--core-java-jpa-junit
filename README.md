# SBA: Core Java/JPA/Junit
This is my submission for the Per Scholas skill-based assessment covering the following topics: Core Java, JPA, and JUnit

NOTES:
- 
- Seed data can auto-populated!
    - To use the seed data, uncomment the last line in the SMSRunner constructor.
- SMSRunner was provided as part of the exercise; but had to be modified because several variable names and methods did not match those listed in the requirements as well as some of the logic needed to be moved.
